# 4D-Chladni

Simulation of Chladni patterns in 4D with Max/Msp/Jitter. This may be what standing waves in a tesseract look like.

What you are seeing are cymatic standing waves inside tesseracts. They produce beautiful four dimensional chladni patterns. The undulating animation is the camera cycling through (and rotating around) the cube-like cross-sections of the tesseract.

### todo 

* Make nicer, higher resolution, smoother renders. 
* Render using stereographic projection
* Figure out how to 3D print some of these shapes
